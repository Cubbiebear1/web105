<h1>Rebecca Johnson</h1>

<p>My name is Rebecca Johnson. I am both a student and staff member here at Mchenry Community College.  I work as the administrative assistant in Access and Disability Services and have worked at the college for almost 25 years, three of those years in my current position. I have been married for ten years to my husband Ron. He and I have four cats. Furry babies are a big part of my life along with armature photography, gardening, knitting, crocheting, and cross-stitching. I also enjoy learning new things. I want to always learn something new every day. I believe without learning, there is no growth, I am taking Web 105 as professional development towards my current position.  </p>
