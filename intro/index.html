   <h2>Hobbies</h2> 
    <h3>Amature Photography</h3>
   <img src="images/sun.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt=" The Sun" > 
   <p>This image was taken this summer during the Canada wildfires of 2023. 
      The haze from the fires created an additional filter to create this effect. 
      I took the picture from the college campus parking lot while on my break with my phone. 
      I am always looking for a potential opportunity to take pictures. </p>

    <img src="images/Switzerland.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="Switzerland" >
    <p>This photograph was taken from a dock on the side of a highway in Switzerland in 1995.
       At the age of eighteen, I was given the opportunity to stay in Germany for six months earning my room and board by working in the kitchen of a retreat center in Vallendar Germany. 
       During my time in Germany,I was offered an opportunity to join a weekend bus trip down to Switzerland. 
       I asked the bus driver to stop as we were driving by this lake so I could take a picture. 
       To my surprise the bus driver obliged and double parked on the highway so I could get this shot. 
       This picture was taken at the end of a dock that lead into this lake. 
       My only regret was that I did not have a better quality camera for this photo.</p>

 <h2>Interests</h2>
    <h3>Reasons for taking Web 105</h3>
    <p>In an effort to be more proficient in my job and due to a love of learning,I chose to take Web 105. 
      I want to learn how to code. One of several of our software packages that our office purchased utilizes 
      HTML for sending messages to our students. Since I like to learn new things, I jumped at the chance to 
      take this class to fill in the gap in knowledge. I can then assist my co-workers with any HTML and CSS coding.
