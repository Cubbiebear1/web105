        <p>
          My name is Rebecca Johnson. I am both a student and staff member here
          at Mchenry County College. I work as the administrative assistant
          in Access and Disability Services and have worked at the college for
          almost 25 years, three of those years in my current position. I have
          been married for ten years to my husband Ron. He and I have four cats.
          Furry babies are a big part of my life along with armature
          photography, gardening, knitting, crocheting, and cross-stitching. I
          also enjoy learning new things. I want to always learn something new
          every day. I believe without learning, there is no growth, I am taking
          Web 105 as professional development towards my current position.
