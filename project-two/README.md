# Project Title

This is project number two, the second of two major assignments required for an Introduction to HTML course offered at McHenry County College. The colors and font chosen were selected due to their implied warmth. I wanted to create a strong correlation with a warm kitchen and invoke the smells of baked goods and cinnamon that can be found in a kitchen or bakery while still providing enough contrast for ease of reading the webpage. This is my best work so far and am very happy with it considering the vast amount of time that I spent on this project. I realize though that I need more practice coding since my photos are not the same size even though the differences are minimal, it still is obvious to me. I also struggle with layouts but have found that Bootstrap 5 simplified my projects greatly.

This project can be opened with a browser or viewed in Visual Studio Code.
