      <p>
        My name is Rebecca Johnson. I am both a student and staff member here at
        Mchenry County College. I work as the administrative assistant in Access
        and Disability Services and have worked at the college for almost 25
        years, three of those years in my current position. I have been married
        for ten years to my husband Ron. He and I have four cats. Furry babies
        are a big part of my life along with armature photography, gardening,
        knitting, crocheting, and cross-stitching. I also enjoy learning new
        things. I want to always learn something new every day. I believe
        without learning, there is no growth, I am taking Web 105 as
        professional development towards my current position.
