    <p>I am reviewing the movie <strong>"The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"</strong> directed by <em>Peter Jackson</em> and based on the novels written by<i> J.R.R. Tolkien. This film was released in 2002 and won four Oscars. </i></p>

    <h2><strong>The Story</strong></h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>The movie "Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring" is the first movie in a series of movies based off the series of novels written by J.R.R. Tolkien. Both the movies and novels address the concept of good and evil and how choices make a difference in the world be it good or evil. Within this battle of good vs. evil, Frodo Baggins has been tasked with destroying the ring of power which brings great evil to the world of middle earth which he had inherited from his cousin Bilbo Baggins. He must journey to the only place where the ring can be distroyed, Mount Doom. This movie lives up to hype with the amazing visuals and scenes. Much ofthe filming was done in New Zealand. The book has a lot more detail than the movies but I feel that Peter Jackson did justice to the writing of J.R.R. Tolkien through his brilliant directing.</p>

    <h3><strong>The Mines of Moria</strong></h3>
    The followoing conversation occurs between the main protagonist, Frodo Baggins and Gandalf the Gray, a wizzard and friend to Frodo while they are traveling through the mines of Moria, a dark and lonely place. <br>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> <q>I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.</q><br>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b><q>So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is
    what to do
    with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world Frodo, besides the will of evil.
    Bilbo
    was meant to find the Ring. In which case, you were also meant to have it. And that is an encouraging
    thought.</q></p>
